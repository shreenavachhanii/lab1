# lab1
this is my first lab work 
here i have done two python program:
In first python program(hello.py) I have used the input function to ask name from the user and then with the help of print function it prints "Hello,my name is and the name which user has given".
In second program(basic.py),I have used two variables and assigned numbers. Another variable named sum is used to display the addition of the two numbers.
